# SmartenIT: Socially-aware Management of New Overlay Application Traffic combined with Energy Efficiency in the Internet

## Overview

The tighter integration of network management, overlay service functionality, and overlay application knowledge, as for instance of Online Social Networks and Quality-of-Experience metrics, can lead to cross-layer optimization of network operations. Therefore, SmartenIT considers this as the promising approach to offer a new business potential in operational perspectives for all stakeholders involved, including cloud providers, Internet Service Providers, telecommunication providers, overlay providers, and application providers.

By addressing accordingly load and traffic patterns of the Internet traffic or special application requirements and by exploiting them at the same time with respect to social awareness (in terms of user relations and interests), QoE-awareness, and energy efficiency with respect to both end-user devices and underlying networking infrastructure, SmartenIT is dedicated to ensure an operationally efficient management of traffic, exemplified with real-life scenarios.
