Prerequisites
==========================

* Oracle JDK 1.7.0_51. Set environment variables JAVA_HOME (<jdk-installation-directory>) and Path (<jdk-installation-directory>/bin)
* Apache Maven 3.1.1. Set environment variables M2_HOME (<maven-installation-directory>) and Path (<maven-installation-directory>/bin)

Build Commands
==========================

* To clean the generated artifacts: mvn clean
* To build the smartenit project: mvn clean install
* To build the system, but skip the JUnit tests: mvn clean install -DskipTests
* To build specific modules of the smartenit project: mvn clean install -pl X,Y,Z --also-make-dependents (where X, Y, Z the modules you want to build). Be careful that this command may fail, due to missing dependencies.
* To produce the maven site of the smartenit project, execute: mvn clean compile site site:stage. Browse the generated target/staging directory and open the index.html.
